Hello Welcome to Liting's Blog🍀☁️👩‍💻💕

 Professionally, I am a student studying financial engineering and computer science @ Columbia 
 
 🌏 Born in China, currently living, studying, and hustling in the city of New York 🏙️☕
 
 I trade across different asset classes -- stocks, cryptos, commodities, etc 
 
 📰 Love geeking out over news, macro trends, trade ideas, and quant strategies—always up for a great discussion! 📊✨
 
 🤖 Firm believer in the future of AI & disruptive tech, and I’m investing my heart (and wallet) into it! 🔮💡
 
 Beyond finance & CS, I love to travel and enjoy discovering new cultures, arts, and histories  🌍🎨📚
 
 🐭 Currently running on Rat investing mode with my humble brokerage account, but one day… Rats Capital shall rise! 🏦🚀
